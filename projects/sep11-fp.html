            <h5 class="text-center">Context</h5>
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating something meaningful using Javascript, which is
                essentially a scripting language that allows the user to interact with webpages in more advanced ways.
                It is a year-long project that involves learning a "tool" that would ultimately assist one in the
                creation of their project. The purpose of this blog is to guide you through my process in the creation
                of my website as well as the challenging obstacles I faced throughout.</p>
            <h5 class="text-center">Content</h5>
            <p>For my project, I am making a platformer game that features a fun experience with enemy sprites for the
                user to pass through to enter the next level. Using the knowledge I acquired from in-class lessons and
                game ideas, I was able to create a platformer game with my partner Lingying. This blog will walk through
                my process of independently learning my tool KaboomJS and platformer games to make a platformer game
                with my partner. Not only that but also the blog will guide you through my journey to my product.</p>
            <h5 class="text-center">Reflection</h5><br>
            <img src="../img/sep11-fp.gif" class="img-fluid project-img img-center"><br>
            <p>Making the platformer game was fun, but it wasn't a smooth ride. My partner and I encountered many
                challenging obstacles in the process of making our game. One major challenge we faced in making the game
                was making the enemy sprite move back and forth so that it would fall off the platform. Originally, the
                enemy sprite went only to the left till it dropped off the platform. We tried for a long time to get the
                sprite moving back and forth for each sprite, but we couldn't. We were able to eventually have one enemy
                sprite moving back and forth after many failed attempts. A valuable takeaway I got from making this game
                was to not give up so easily. I wanted to give up on making the sprites move back and forth many times,
                but I was determined by the result so I kept trying to figure out how to make it work. Even though I
                ended up only being able to get one enemy sprite to move, I still put in my best effort to make it work.
                My next step in my freedom project will be making an instructions page that will introduce users to the
                game controls before playing the game. This would be useful to introduce the users to the game controls
                that would allow the user to move the sprite.</p>
