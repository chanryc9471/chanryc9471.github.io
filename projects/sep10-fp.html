            <h5 class="text-center">Context</h5>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about how technology has influenced numerous different industries. As society continues to grow, technology also continues to grow with society. Technology is all around us, whether we know it or not. It has shaped how we live our daily lives and has become a necessity for us all. Using the acquired knowledge throughout the school year as well as a tool I learned in my own time, I created a website based on what I was passionate about, which was architecture. Many people may not know how technology is used in many industries, but the website assists with that. The website features how technology has impacted the topic previously, and how it will continue to do so in the future. The purpose of the website is to encourage readers to explore how technology is applied in architecture through software and hardware inventions that exist today as well as possible inventions for the future.</p><br>
            <h5 class="text-center">Content</h5>
            <p>For the project, I made a website about technology in architecture using HTML, CSS, Github, Sass, and Bootstrap. On the website are past inventions that have existed and influenced the architectural field, as well as possible inventions I brainstormed that could exist in that field.</p><br>
            <h5 class="text-center">Reflection</h5>

            <p class="text-center">Image of Hardware Section of Website *</p>
            <p>As fun as it was making the website. I had to overcome some challenges, one being the arrangement of the cards in the hardware section of the website. When the website was on a fullscreen viewport, the cards were all in one row, since one was below the other cards. I used the inspect tool to figure out what was causing that to happen. I found the class and I fixed the issue. An important takeaway I got from this project was to use the inspector tool to observe and tinker. I was able to fix the issue with the cards because I used the inspector tool to section out the things that were affecting the code.</p><br>
